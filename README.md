### A simple exercise in HTML, CSS and responsive design

This is based on the exercise provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef). 

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make it work. So no need to install anything else. The website is responsive and can also accomodate mobile devices.
